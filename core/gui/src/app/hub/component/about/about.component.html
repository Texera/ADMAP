    <h1>Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Atlasing Project</h1>

    <p>
      <br />
      The Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Atlasing Project (ADMAP) is a collaborative initiative at the UCI Center for
      Neural Circuit Mapping.
      <br />
      It aims to advance research on Alzheimer's disease by providing a platform for researchers to upload, explore, and
      download datasets.
      <br />
    </p>

    <h2 class="content-title">Key Features</h2>
    <ul class="text-content">
      <li>
        Comprehensively characterize brain circuits susceptible to Alzheimer's disease type pathology and/or
        neurodegeneration in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      </li>
      <li>
        Share data on the cellular connectome in the aging and AD brain in a common reference brain cell atlas that
        integrates both molecular and anatomical annotations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complement and extend research on vulnerable cell types to include the mapping of connectivity changes between
        cells in aging and AD and provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying resilience and
        vulnerability in AD.
      </li>
